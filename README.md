# Flova Authentication Flow (Sign In/Sign Up)

This is the authentication flow module for **Flova**, featuring **Sign In**, **Sign Up**, and **Reset Password** functionalities. It is designed to provide an easy-to-integrate authentication process for web applications, making it simple to manage user registration, login, and password recovery.

### Simulations:

This project includes **simulated** functionality for the sign-up and login process, providing a realistic experience without the need for a backend. These simulations mimic account creation, sign-in, and password reset, providing feedback during the process. It can be useful for testing the front-end flow before integrating with an actual backend.

## Features

- **Sign Up**: Allows new users to create an account with an email, password, and password confirmation. Includes basic password strength validation.
- **Sign In**: Lets users log in using their registered email and password.
- **Reset Password**: Provides a way for users to reset their password if they forget it, through a simple password reset mechanism.
- **Google Authentication**: Option to sign in with Google for a more convenient login process.
- **Password Strength Meter**: The system provides feedback on the strength of the userâ€™s password during sign-up.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience on both mobile and desktop.
- **Simulated Account Creation**: For the sign-up process, users will receive a simulated success message once the account is created (without actually storing data anywhere).
- **Simulated Sign-In**: For the login process, users will be redirected with a simulated success message once login is successful.
- **Simulated Password Reset**: The password reset functionality shows a simulation of sending a reset link to the user's email.

## Demo

- **Sign In**: Users can sign in with their email and password.
- **Sign Up**: New users can create an account with their email, password, and confirmation of the password.
- **Reset Password**: Users can request a password reset if they forget their password.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed language that builds on JavaScript, providing optional types.
